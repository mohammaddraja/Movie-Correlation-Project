Analyzing Correlations in the Movie Industry
This Jupyter Notebook delves into the movie industry to uncover the relationships between various factors, with a particular emphasis on how movie budgets correlate with gross earnings.

In this project, we'll utilize pandas to process a CSV file containing global movie data from 1980 to 2020. Our objective is to examine correlations among several attributes, including movie names, ratings, genres, release dates, scores, votes, and financial metrics like budget and gross revenue.

Overview
The primary goals of this analysis are:

To identify which movies achieved the highest gross revenue.
To determine whether there is a correlation between a movie's budget and its gross earnings.
The notebook covers the following steps:

Loading and initially exploring the dataset.
Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
Visualizing the relationships between different variables.
Calculating correlations using Pearson, Kendall, and Spearman methods.
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites

Make sure Python is installed on your system along with these packages:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
Running the Notebook

Clone this repository or download the notebook file.
Ensure the Movies Data.csv file is in the same directory as the notebook.
Open the notebook and run the cells in order.
Data
The dataset for this analysis is in a CSV file named Movies Data.csv, which includes these key columns:

name: The title of the movie.
director: The director of the film.
budget: The film's budget.
gross: The total earnings of the movie.
released: The date of release.
Analysis
Data Cleaning

Checked for missing values and assigned the appropriate data types.
Created a new year column by extracting the year from the released date.
Visualizations

Scatter Plots (Matplotlib): Used to illustrate the relationship between movie budgets and gross earnings.
Scatter Plots (Seaborn): Confirmed a positive correlation between budget and earnings.
Correlation Analysis

To evaluate correlations, we used:

Pearson Correlation: Assesses linear relationships between variables.
Kendall's Tau: Measures the strength of dependency between variables based on ranks.
Spearman's Rank Correlation: Examines how well the relationship between variables can be described by a monotonic function.
In this project, we primarily used Kendall's Tau for correlation calculations.

Correlation Matrices

Numeric Columns: Including runtime, gross, budget, votes, score, and year.
All Columns: Comparing all available attributes.
Conclusion
The analysis indicates a positive correlation between a movieâ€™s budget and its gross revenue, suggesting that films with higher budgets tend to generate greater earnings.
